# Work_with_matrix
The sixth laboratory work in the first year of the Faculty of Mathematics of YarSU on the basics of programming in C++

Task 1 (laba_6_1, funcs).

Matrices and operations on them. A square matrix A with a size of no more than 1000 * 1000 is sent to the program input. The elements of the matrix are real numbers. Given a polynomial f(x) or polynomials f(x) and g(x). The expression A - k should be understood as A - kE, where E is the identity matrix. It is necessary to calculate the value of the expression according to the variant and output the intermediate results of the calculations.

My task: f(x) = x^3 − 10x^2 + 7x − 12. Find f(A^2).

Task 2 (laba_6_2, funcs2).

Determinants. If the task involves recursive calculation of the determinant by decomposition by row or column, then we can assume that the order of the matrix does not exceed 10.

My task: Given a matrix, check whether it is orthogonal (the inverse matrix is equal to the transposed one).

Task 3 (laba_6_3, funcs3).

Matrix equations. Write a program that solves a given matrix equation or a system of matrix equations. Perform the check by displaying the intermediate results of calculations.

My task: A system of two equations:

2X + Y = a11 = 5, a12 = 3, a21 = −1, a22 = −1

X - 2Y = b11 = −5, b12 = −6, b21 = −3, b22 = 2
